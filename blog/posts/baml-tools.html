      <p>Let's start at the end and work backwards. At work we sometimes need
        to extract values from semi-structured documents like 10-Qs or earnings
        call transcripts for example. Here‚Äôs a quick script I wrote while
        exploring BAML:</p>
      <pre class="blog-code-block"><code>$ uv run main.py &quot;Combined Walmart U.S. and Samsclub U.S. net sales&quot; --url &quot;https://stock.walmart.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0000104169-25-000137/0000104169-25-000137.pdf&quot;

# Output:

{
  &quot;company&quot;: &quot;Walmart Inc.&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Combined net sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam&#39;s Club U.S. segments for the six months ended July 31, 2025.&quot;,
  &quot;derivation&quot;: 278776000000,
  &quot;facts&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;value&quot;: 233074000000,
      &quot;units&quot;: &quot;USD&quot;,
      &quot;start_date&quot;: &quot;2025-02-01&quot;,
      &quot;end_date&quot;: &quot;2025-07-31&quot;,
      &quot;location&quot;: &quot;Page 15, Segment Information table, under the &#39;Walmart U.S.&#39; section, in the &#39;Net sales&#39; row and &#39;2025&#39; column for the Six Months Ended July 31.&quot;
    },
    {

      &quot;location&quot;: &quot;Page 15, Segment Information table, under the &#39;Sam&#39;s Club U.S.&#39; section, in the &#39;Net sales&#39; row and &#39;2025&#39; column for the Six Months Ended July 31.&quot;
    }
  ]
}</code></pre>
      <p>These facts can sometimes be teased out with existing archaic and
        very tedious solutions like XBRL tags (made much simpler with the
        excellent <a href="https://github.com/dgunning/edgartools">Edgartools
          library</a>, go check it out), but the tags are managed by the filers,
        and sometimes what we need out of the document is not tagged. Not to
        mention that XBRL is really only a standard for US filings, let alone
        Canadian/EU filings. Thus, we would like to have one solution to rule
        them all.. Since it‚Äôs a document extraction tool, your first instinct
        might just be to send the PDF to chatgpt and see if it gets the answer
        right. Sure enough, it does so pretty often. LLMs are exceedingly good
        at pulling out relevant facts from deep within documents like this. For
        example: commit hashes, facts and figures, exact dates and timestamps,
        the LLM is really good at regurgitating these facts just because of how
        the underlying transformer models work. Note that I‚Äôm no ML scientist,
        and my hand waving here should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>
      <p>Tool calls are neat. They are what break out a single LLM call into a
        multi-turn agent that can actually interact with something on the
        outside. Orchestrating tool calls is relatively simple when you use a
        library like <code>openai</code> - however, with BAML things are a bit
        more low level. <strong>This is a good thing.</strong> Before trying
        BAML, I never truly understood what was happening under the hood when an
        LLM ‚Äúdecided‚Äù to make a tool call. What was that handoff process like?
        With BAML everything is nice and transparent. You can see everything as
        it happens and the tooling around the language makes it very easy to
        test each prompt as a function with simple inputs/outputs.</p>
      <p>Basically, the BAML functions serve as a function interface to LLM
        prompts. Things go in and come out. BAML tries to help shape the data
        flowing in and out in a reasonably transparent way. Any real compute
        done in a BAML function is <em>purely</em> LLM state transfer. BAML
        functions are true pure functions, and side effects/mess is handled in
        the application layer rather than the routing layer.</p>
      <p>To do the trick I showed at the beginning of the article, I‚Äôve
        defined a few datatypes:</p>
      <pre class="blog-code-block"><code>class Fact {
  value int @description(#&quot;
    If the value is in currency, round to the nearest whole dollar. For example, always expand &quot;$12.8 millions&quot; to 12800000 &quot;USD&quot;
  &quot;#)
  units string
  start_date string
  end_date string?
  location string? @description(#&quot;
    A plain text description of where this fact can be found on the PDF
  &quot;#)
}

class FilingInformation {
  company string
  description string
  derivation int? @description(#&quot;
    If asked for multi-fact calculation, put the *final calculation* here in whole USD
  &quot;#)
  facts Fact[] @description(#&quot;
    If asked for a multi-fact calculation, put the *base facts* here
  &quot;#)
}

class CalculatorRequest {
    equation string

    @@assert(contains_operation, {{ this|regex_match(&quot;[*-+/]&quot;) }} )
}</code></pre>
      <p>These are my data models. Basically users can extract filing
        information from an SEC filing (or any document, as you‚Äôll see next) and
        back it up with cold hard facts üòé. These facts contain a value, units,
        start/end dates, and a location description so that you can find the
        fact in the doc for debugging purposes. Now, onto the functions</p>
      <pre class="blog-code-block"><code>function SearchDoc(document: pdf, query: string) -&gt; FilingInformation {
  client Gemini
  prompt #&quot;
    Extract the information from the document below.
    Always prefer to source a fact from within a table if possible.

    Info: {{query}}
    Document: {{document}}

    {{ ctx.output_format }}
  &quot;#
}

function NeedCalculator(message: string, facts: Fact[]) -&gt; CalculatorRequest {
  client Gpt5Nano
  prompt #&quot;
    Given a message, create an expression that best represents the user&#39;s
    request.  If you don&#39;t have to calculate anything, return null.
    Never give the answer or include the units. Always just raw numbers and
    a symbolic arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /)

    {{ ctx.output_format }}

    {{ _.role(&quot;user&quot;) }} {{ message }}
    {{ _.role(&quot;user&quot;) }} {{ facts }}
  &quot;#
}</code></pre>
      <p>These are the only two BAML functions we need. SearchDoc is a
        function that accepts a PDF and a query, returning some sort of filing
        information. NeedCalculator is a poorly named function that takes a
        message (better thought of as the original query) and a list of facts
        and turns it into an equation. If you check the models above, you‚Äôll see
        that the CalculatorRequest output type is literally just a string named
        ‚Äúequation.‚Äù This is both hilarious and deeply concerning. How do we
        solve an equation as a string? It turns out LLMs are very good at
        solving these simple arithmetic problems, but they‚Äôre just not
        trustworthy (read: deterministic) enough to trust their calculations
        even though they are correct very often. To remedy this, I thought we
        could just bring a nuke to a paintball match and
        <code>import sympy</code> - a full blown symbolic algebra system üòÄ.
        Now, if the LLM ever decides to calculate derivatives or solve
        differential equations, it has the tools at its disposal.
      </p>
      <p>So now how do we orchestrate all of this? It‚Äôs pretty simple! BAML
        works kind of like an OpenAPI spec generator if you‚Äôve ever used one
        before. Every time you save your work, it regenerates the client super
        quickly (like in 5ms) which regenerates python files using pydantic for
        data modeling in our case. Just like with openapi codegen, many
        languages are supported (go, typescript, python, etc). You can then
        import the client and use the types and functions you‚Äôve defined in your
        <code>*.baml</code> files. The code to orchestrate pretty much looks
        like this:
      </p>
      <pre class="blog-code-block"><code>import argparse
from utils import encode_file_to_base64
from baml_py import Pdf
from baml_client.sync_client import b

if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=&#39;Search a PDF document for information&#39;)
  parser.add_argument(&#39;query&#39;, help=&#39;Search query for the document&#39;)
  parser.add_argument(&#39;--url&#39;, required=True, help=&#39;URL or path to the PDF document&#39;)

  args = parser.parse_args()

  pdf = Pdf.from_base64(encode_file_to_base64(args.url))
  result = b.SearchDoc(document=pdf, query=args.query)

  if len(result.facts) &gt; 1:
    request = b.NeedCalculator(
      message=args.query,
      facts=result.facts
    )

    from sympy.parsing.mathematica import parse_mathematica
    derivation = parse_mathematica(request.equation)
    result.derivation = derivation.doit()

    print(result.model_dump_json(indent=2))</code></pre>
      <p>Note how there are no import statements for openai, gemini,
        anthropic, etc. <strong>I haven‚Äôt even told you yet that I am using two
          totally different model providers here!</strong> I‚Äôve used
        <code>gemini-2.5-pro</code> for the more complicated document parsing
        and <code>gpt-5-nano</code> for generating the simple equation! I can
        mix and match models or run requests to different models concurrently
        taking the first one to respond. I can even round-robin them if I want
        (a concept I first read about in <a href="https://xbow.com/blog/alloy-agents">XBOW‚Äôs post on alloys</a>
        which I am very excited to try out in the future). You can also easily
        plug in openai compatible local LLM servers like Ollama and
        LMStudio.
      </p>
      <pre class="blog-code-block"><code>client&lt;llm&gt; Gpt5Nano {
  provider openai
  options {
    model &quot;gpt-5-nano&quot;
    api_key env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  }
}

client&lt;llm&gt; Gemini {
  provider google-ai
  options {
    model &quot;gemini-2.5-pro&quot;
    api_key env.GEMINI_API_KEY
  }
}

client&lt;llm&gt; Lmstudio {
  provider openai-generic
  options {
    model &quot;google/gemma-3-4b&quot;
    base_url &quot;http://localhost:1234/v1&quot;
  }
}</code></pre>
      <p>In conclusion, I don‚Äôt know what the future holds for programming
        agents and baking LLMs into software, but this approach is a great
        glimpse into how the future may look. I didn‚Äôt even get into the concept
        of evals, which if your calls to the LLM are factored out into pure
        functions are now trivial to implement in BAML. The tooling around
        building things with LLMs is getting better every day. There are about a
        million different very opinionated frameworks, and sometimes it‚Äôs nice
        to step back into a more flexible lower level of the stack for a
        change.</p>
