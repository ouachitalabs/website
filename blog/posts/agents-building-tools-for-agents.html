        With agentic coding assistants like VS Code's <a
          href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode">agent mode</a>, <a
          href="https://www.cursor.com">Cursor</a>, and my personal favorite <a
          href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code">Claude code</a>, building niche tools is faster and easier than
        ever before.
        Writing throwaway software used to be a luxury. It still happened of course, I'm not saying it's ever been
        impossible,
        but the process was often more complicated than just doing the task manually.
        But agents have changed the calculation, what used to take a week to build now takes hours.
        Costs to maintain such software has gone down a ton.
        I'm confident out of all of the software that will be 100% maintained by agents, over 50% of it will be this
        kind of niche software.
        The XKCD comic below is a greate example of the old way of thinking about throwaway scripts and software.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        Nowadays, the debugging, rethinking, and ongoing development tasks of these tools can be 100% delegated to your
        agent.
        It's still not quite 100% automated yet, but the calculation has definitely changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        This rapid development cycle for developer experience utilities is the most underrated way to increase
        productivity with agents.
        If there's a manual interaction with a web service that has an API, build a command line tool for your agent to
        use.
        The biggest boost from agents versus chat-only LLMs is, well, their <strong>agency</strong>.
        The ability for an agent to call tools and interpret the results are what makes them so useful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Take this <a
          href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices#2-give-claude-more-tools">example from
          Anthropic</a> about the already popular <code>gh</code> command:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        Claude knows how to use the gh CLI to interact with GitHub for creating issues, opening pull requests,
        reading comments, and more. Without gh installed, Claude can still use the GitHub API or MCP server (if you
        have it installed).
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        You should be thinking about how to build the <code>gh</code> for your team or service. Building niche tools for
        your agents will set you apart from those who just copy and paste code in and out of cursor.
      </p>

      <h2>The legacy workflow</h2>

      <p>
        Before agents, developers could mount their code in a docker volume that would update regularly. The flow was:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Write code</li>
        <li>Import error</li>
        <li>Fix code</li>
        <li>Trigger dag</li>
        <li>Task failed</li>
        <li>Fix code</li>
        <li>Clear tasks</li>
        <li>Finally watch logs succeed</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This iteration loop was completely broken. Imagine a random slack huddle pop up throwing you out of the zone in
        the middle of this loop. Experienced developers have consistently noted that <a
          href="https://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">context switching</a> is the number one killer of your
        productivity. The context switch between your agent and your system that you're working on is just as expensive.
      </p>

      <h2>Practical example with afcli</h2>

      <p>
        For my data engineering work, I built <a href="https://pypi.org/project/afcli"><code>afcli</code></a> to
        streamline Airflow development. The key feature: <code>--host</code> functionality that points directly to a
        running Airflow instance, eliminating the need to find docker container IDs and run complex exec commands.
      </p>

      <p>
        In your <a href="http://CLAUDE.md">CLAUDE.md</a>, add:
      </p>
      <pre class="blog-code-block"><code>When building with airflow, check the dag and task level statuses with `afcli`.
Use `afcli` for fetching logs and to validate your changes.
After making a change, run `afcli` to kick off the dag or task that you're working on and iterate until every task succeeds.
Run `afcli --help` to understand common usage patterns and specific CLI options.</code>
      </pre>

      <p>Giving your agent instructions on how to iterate faster unlocks a tight loop that will
        let you turn features around faster than ever.</p>

      <div class="blog-section-divider">
        <h2>Next Steps</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Audit your workflow for repetitive API interactions</li>
            <li>Pick one service and build a simple CLI wrapper if it doesn't exist yet</li>
            <li>Add it to your agent's toolkit (CLAUDE.md or equivalent)</li>
            <li>Iterate based on what your agent struggles with</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Try it yourself:</strong> <code>pip install afcli</code> for Airflow development, or build your own
            tool for your specific needs.
